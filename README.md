# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker


## 📌 Description
This project is a data analysis and reporting notebook that tracks global COVID-19 trends across countries and time. It explores cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination progress using real-world datasets.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Import and clean COVID-19 global data
- Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- Compare metrics across countries/regions
- Visualize trends with charts and maps
- Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly (optional)
- geopandas (optional)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Place the COVID dataset (`owid-covid-data.csv`) in the working directory.
3. Open the notebook: `covid19_data_analysis.ipynb`.
4. Run all cells from top to bottom.

## 🧠 Insights & Reflections
- Country X had the fastest vaccine rollout.
- Country Y experienced a second wave in Month Z.
- Death rates were consistently highest in Country A.
- Some developing countries reported low testing, skewing confirmed case trends.
